This demonstration documents the features of
[Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep) and acts as a test for
it.  Markdeep is a text formatting syntax that extends Markdown, and a
Javascript program for making it work in browsers. The two most
powerful features are its ability to run in any **web browser** on the
client side and the inclusion of **diagrams**.

# Trying titles my way
[Click here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html?noformat)
to see this document without automatic formatting.

Markdeep is free and easy to use. It doesn't need a plugin, or
Internet connection. There's nothing to install. Just start
writing in Vi, Nodepad, Zed, Emacs, Visual Studio, Atom, or another
editor! You don't have to export, compile, or otherwise process
your document.

If you want to support development of Markdeep, you can
[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/morgan3d) these projects on GitHub
for $2 or just buy my [Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com) book for $10 on Amazon. 
Revenue from the book funds my open source projects.


Basic Formatting
=======================================================================================
Text formatting: 

Source                               |     Result
-----------------------------------------|------------------------------
`**bold**`                               | **bold**
`__bold__`                               | __bold__
`*italic*`                               | *italic*
`_italic_`                               | _italic_
`~~strikethrough~~`                      | ~~strikethrough~~
<code>`inline code`</code>               | `inline code`
`[news](https://cbc.ca)`                 | [news](https://cbc.ca)
`https://casual-effects.com`             | https://casual-effects.com
`morgan@casual-effects.com`              | morgan@casual-effects.com
`5 kg/m^3`                               | 5 kg/m^3
`5 degrees`                              | 5 degrees
`x<sub>below</sub>`                      | x<sub>below</sub>
`<small>size</small>`                    | <small>size</small>
`<big>size</big>`                        | <big>size</big>

You can add CSS to change the styles. See the Custom Formatting section
for some examples.

Formatted text may **cross
lines** and be as small as **a** single character. It can _also
be indented and
split across lines_ simultaneously.

Markdeep intelligently does not apply bold or italic formatting to
math expressions such as x = 3 * y - 2 * z or WORDS_WITH_INTERNAL_UNDERSCORES.
It also protects HTML `<tags>` in code blocks from disappearing.

If you _want_ italics or bold inside of a word, for example in: SCUBA = <b>S</b>elf <b>C</b>ontained
<b>U</b>nderwater <b>B</b>reathing <b>A</b>pparatus, then just use HTML `<b>` and `<i>`
tags---a markdown syntax won't be any more readable in that case.

Exponents only work for positive and negative integers. For arbitrary exponents,
use LaTeX notation: `$x^y$` ==> $x^y$, or HTML tags: `x<sup>y</sup>` ==> x<sup>y</sup>.
